# MIS201Circularlinkedlistasciitablehw
This project involves implementing a circular linked list
with ASCII table images inside the command prompt. The idea is to use the linked list logic to perform slideshows, where
each slide is represented by a node in the list 
containing an ASCII table image. The images are then displayed in the console using the ASCII representation.

I made it for my MIS201 Data Algorithms and structures course
